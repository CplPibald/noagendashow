# No Agenda stream scripts
By SirBemrose

## NAStreamUpdater
Latest version of stream feed updater.  Powershell module that queries podcastindex.org for updates to subscribed
shows, and outputs a stream-ready file metadata and a download link.

## updater-v1.0
Previous version of feed updater, which queries RSS feeds directly.  Slow, but doesn't rely on podcastindex
